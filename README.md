# GPSDO-V4-Interface
This is a companion board for the V4 GPSDO project.
It brings out all required signals, most with insulation, to avoid ground loops and disturbing the GPSDO.

A lot of detail can be found on my Blog here: https://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2023/06/gpsdo-version-4.html Be sure to visit that regularly to see if there are any updates.

If you want to use JLCPCB for the boards, you need to use the special ZIP file that was created with their "production" plug-in for KiCad. The Gerber Zip file contains the extra files so you can upload everything in one go.
